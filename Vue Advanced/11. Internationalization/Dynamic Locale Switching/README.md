# Dynamic Locale Switching

## Introduction
Dynamic Locale Switching in Vue.js allows applications to change the language or locale at runtime without requiring a page reload. This feature is crucial for creating user-friendly, multilingual applications.

## Real-Life Example
Imagine a travel booking website where users can switch between languages like English, Spanish, and French on the fly. Dynamic Locale Switching ensures a seamless experience without disrupting the user's workflow.

## Code Example
```javascript
<template>
  <div>
    <p>{{ $t('welcome') }}</p>
    <button @click="changeLocale('en')">English</button>
    <button @click="changeLocale('fr')">French</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  methods: {
    changeLocale(locale) {
      this.$i18n.locale = locale;
    }
  }
};
</script>

<script setup>
import { useI18n } from 'vue-i18n';
const { t, locale } = useI18n();
</script>

## Problems It Solves
