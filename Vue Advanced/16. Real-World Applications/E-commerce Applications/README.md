# E-commerce Applications

## Introduction
Vue.js is an excellent choice for building e-commerce applications due to its flexibility, performance, and rich ecosystem. Features like state management, routing, and component-based architecture make it ideal for creating dynamic and scalable online stores.

## Real-Life Example
Consider an online store that allows users to browse products, add items to a cart, and complete purchases with a seamless user experience.

## Code Example
```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <product-list :products="products" />
    <shopping-cart :items="cartItems" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import ProductList from './ProductList.vue';
import ShoppingCart from './ShoppingCart.vue';

export default {
  components: {
    ProductList,
    ShoppingCart
  },
  data() {
    return {
      products: [/* ... */],
      cartItems: [/* ... */]
    };
  }
};
</script>
```
