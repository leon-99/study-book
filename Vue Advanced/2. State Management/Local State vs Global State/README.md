# Local State vs Global State

## Introduction
In Vue.js, state can be managed locally within a component or globally across the application. Understanding when to use local state versus global state is crucial for building scalable and maintainable applications.

## Real-Life Example
Think of a family. Local state is like personal belongings kept in individual rooms, while global state is like shared resources in the living room. Each has its purpose and scope.

## Code Example
### Local State
```javascript
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      localCount: 0
    };
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.localCount++;
    }
  }
};
```

### Global State (using Vuex)
```javascript
import { mapState } from 'vuex';

export default {
  computed: {
    ...mapState(['globalCount'])
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.$store.commit('increment');
    }
  }
};
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Local State**: Simplifies state management for isolated components.
- **Global State**: Ensures consistency and coordination across components.

## Real-Life Usage
- **Local State**: Managing form inputs or UI-specific data.
- **Global State**: Handling user authentication, themes, or shared data.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- **Local State**: Easy to implement and debug.
- **Global State**: Provides a single source of truth.

### Cons
- **Local State**: Can lead to duplication of logic.
- **Global State**: Adds complexity and overhead.

## Conclusion
Choosing between local and global state depends on the application's requirements. By understanding their strengths and limitations, developers can make informed decisions to manage state effectively.
