# Custom Composition Functions

## Introduction
Custom composition functions in Vue.js allow developers to encapsulate and reuse logic across components. They are a key feature of the Composition API, promoting modularity and code reuse.

## Real-Life Example
Think of a recipe book. Each recipe (function) contains reusable instructions that can be applied to different dishes (components).

## Code Example
```javascript
import { ref } from 'vue';

export function useCounter() {
  const count = ref(0);
  const increment = () => count.value++;
  return { count, increment };
}

// In a component
import { useCounter } from './useCounter';

export default {
  setup() {
    const { count, increment } = useCounter();
    return { count, increment };
  }
};
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Code Reusability**: Encapsulates reusable logic in a single place.
- **Code Organization**: Simplifies the organization of component logic.
- **Scalability**: Promotes modularity in large applications.

## Real-Life Usage
Custom composition functions are used in:
- **UI Libraries**: Encapsulating reusable logic for components.
- **Forms**: Managing form state and validation.
- **Dashboards**: Handling shared logic for widgets or charts.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Promotes code reuse and modularity.
- Simplifies the organization of component logic.
- Enhances scalability and maintainability.

### Cons
- Requires a learning curve for developers new to the Composition API.
- May add complexity to simple components.

## Conclusion
Custom composition functions are a powerful feature of Vue.js that enable developers to encapsulate and reuse logic across components. By leveraging these functions, developers can build scalable and maintainable applications.
