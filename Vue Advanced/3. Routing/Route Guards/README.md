# Route Guards

## Introduction
Route guards in Vue Router are functions that allow developers to control navigation by executing logic before a route is entered, left, or resolved. They are essential for implementing authentication, authorization, and other access control mechanisms.

## Real-Life Example
Think of a security checkpoint at an airport. Before entering a restricted area, passengers must pass through checks to ensure they meet the requirements. Similarly, route guards validate conditions before allowing navigation.

## Code Example
```javascript
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/dashboard',
    component: Dashboard,
    beforeEnter: (to, from, next) => {
      if (isAuthenticated()) {
        next();
      } else {
        next('/login');
      }
    }
  }
];

function isAuthenticated() {
  return !!localStorage.getItem('authToken');
}
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Access Control**: Ensures only authorized users can access certain routes.
- **Data Validation**: Validates data or state before navigation.
- **Error Handling**: Redirects users to error pages or fallback routes.

## Real-Life Usage
Route guards are used in:
- **Authentication**: Protecting private routes in web applications.
- **E-commerce**: Restricting access to checkout pages for logged-in users.
- **Dashboards**: Ensuring users have the necessary permissions to access specific modules.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Enhances security and user experience.
- Provides fine-grained control over navigation.
- Simplifies implementation of access control.

### Cons
- Can add complexity to the routing configuration.
- May impact performance if overused.

## Conclusion
Route guards are a vital feature of Vue Router that enable developers to implement robust access control and navigation logic. By mastering route guards, developers can build secure and user-friendly applications.
