# Vue Lifecycle Hooks

## Introduction
Vue lifecycle hooks are special functions that allow developers to execute code at specific stages of a component's lifecycle, such as creation, mounting, updating, and destruction.

## Real-Life Example
Imagine a stage play. The lifecycle hooks are like the different stages of the play: setting up the stage (creation), starting the play (mounting), making changes during the play (updating), and cleaning up after the play ends (destruction).

## Code Example
```javascript
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      message: 'Hello, Vue!'
    };
  },
  created() {
    console.log('Component created');
  },
  mounted() {
    console.log('Component mounted');
  },
  updated() {
    console.log('Component updated');
  },
  destroyed() {
    console.log('Component destroyed');
  }
};
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Initialization**: Setting up data or fetching initial data.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Performing actions after the DOM is ready.
- **Cleanup**: Removing event listeners or timers when a component is destroyed.

## Real-Life Usage
Lifecycle hooks are used in:
- **Data Fetching**: Fetching data when a component is created or mounted.
- **Event Listeners**: Adding and removing event listeners dynamically.
- **Animations**: Triggering animations at specific stages of a component's lifecycle.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Provides fine-grained control over a component's lifecycle.
- Simplifies complex logic by breaking it into stages.
- Enhances code readability and maintainability.

### Cons
- Overuse can lead to tightly coupled components.
- Requires understanding of the component lifecycle to use effectively.

## Conclusion
Vue lifecycle hooks are a powerful tool for managing a component's lifecycle. By leveraging these hooks, developers can create dynamic and responsive applications with ease.
