# Transition Groups

## Introduction
Transition groups in Vue.js allow developers to apply animations to a group of elements or components as they enter, leave, or change state. This feature is particularly useful for creating dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces.

## Real-Life Example
Imagine a photo gallery where images fade in and out as you navigate through them. Transition groups make it easy to implement such effects seamlessly.

## Code Example
```vue
<template>
  <transition-group name="fade" tag="div">
    <div v-for="item in items" :key="item.id" class="list-item">
      {{ item.text }}
    </div>
  </transition-group>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      items: [
        { id: 1, text: 'Item 1' },
        { id: 2, text: 'Item 2' },
        { id: 3, text: 'Item 3' }
      ];
    };
  }
};
</script>

<style>
.fade-enter-active, .fade-leave-active {
  transition: opacity 0.5s;
}
.fade-enter, .fade-leave-to {
  opacity: 0;
}
</style>
```
