GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is a powerful JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations. Integrating GSAP with Vue.js allows developers to create complex and visually stunning animations with ease.

## Real-Life Example
Imagine a landing page with animated text, images, and buttons that draw the user's attention. GSAP can be used to orchestrate these animations seamlessly.

## Code Example

</template>

<script>
import { gsap } from 'gsap';

export default {
  mounted() {
    gsap.to(this.$refs.box, {
      duration: 1,
      x: 100,
      rotation: 360,
      scale: 1.5
    });
  }
};
</script>

<style>
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: #42b983;
  margin: 20px;
}
</style>
```
