# Custom Animations

## Introduction
Custom Animations in Vue.js allow developers to go beyond the default transition effects and create unique, tailored animations for their applications. This can be achieved using CSS animations, JavaScript hooks, or third-party libraries.

## Real-Life Example
Consider a shopping cart where items "fly" into the cart when added. Custom animations can be used to create this effect, providing a more interactive and engaging experience.

## Code Example
```vue
<template>
  <transition
    name="custom"
    @before-enter="beforeEnter"
    @enter="enter"
    @leave="leave"
  >
    <div v-if="show" class="box">Hello World</div>
  </transition>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      show: true
    };
  },
  methods: {
    beforeEnter(el) {
      el.style.opacity = 0;
      el.style.transform = 'scale(0.5)';
    },
    enter(el, done) {
      el.offsetHeight; // trigger reflow
      el.style.transition = 'all 0.5s';
      el.style.opacity = 1;
      el.style.transform = 'scale(1)';
      done();
    },
    leave(el, done) {
      el.style.transition = 'all 0.5s';
      el.style.opacity = 0;
      el.style.transform = 'scale(0.5)';
      setTimeout(done, 500);
    }
  }
};
</script>

<style>
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: #42b983;
  margin: 20px;
}
</style>
```
