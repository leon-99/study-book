# Authentication and Authorization

## Introduction
Authentication and authorization are critical components of web application security. Authentication verifies a user's identity, while authorization determines their access rights. Vue.js integrates seamlessly with libraries and backend services to implement these features.

## Real-Life Example
Consider an online banking application where users must log in to view their account details and perform transactions. Different roles, such as admin and user, have varying access levels.

## Code Example
```javascript
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p v-if="!isAuthenticated">Please log in to continue.</p>
    <p v-else>Welcome back, {{ user.name }}!</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { useAuth } from './auth';

export default {
  setup() {
    const { isAuthenticated, user, login } = useAuth();
    return {
      isAuthenticated,
      user,
      login
    };
  }
};
</script>
```

## Problems It Solves
- **User Verification**: Ensures only authorized users can access the application.
- **Access Control**: Restricts access to sensitive data and features.
- **Security**: Protects against unauthorized access and data breaches.

## Real-Life Usage
- **E-commerce**: Managing user accounts and order history.
- **Banking**: Securing financial transactions and account details.
- **Enterprise Applications**: Implementing role-based access control.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Enhances application security.
- Provides a seamless user experience.
- Integrates with various authentication providers.

### Cons
- Requires additional setup and configuration.
- Can be complex to implement for advanced use cases.

## Conclusion
Authentication and authorization are essential for securing web applications. By leveraging Vue.js and its ecosystem, developers can implement robust security measures to protect their applications and users.
