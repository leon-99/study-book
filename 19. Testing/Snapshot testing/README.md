# Snapshot Testing

## Introduction
Snapshot testing is a technique in software testing where the output of a component or function is captured and compared to a previously stored snapshot. This ensures that the output remains consistent over time.

## Real-Life Example
Imagine testing a React component's rendered output to ensure it doesn't change unexpectedly after updates.

## Code Example
```javascript
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

const tree = renderer.create(<MyComponent />).toJSON();
expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
```

## Problems It Solves
- Detects unintended changes in UI or logic
- Simplifies regression testing

## Real-Life Usage
1. **UI Testing**: Ensuring React components render as expected.
2. **API Testing**: Verifying API responses remain consistent.

## Pros
- Easy to implement
- Provides a clear history of changes

## Cons
- Snapshots can become outdated
- May lead to false positives

## Conclusion
Snapshot testing is a valuable tool for maintaining consistency in software, especially in UI-heavy applications.
