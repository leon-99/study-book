# File Downloads

## Introduction
File downloads allow users to retrieve files from the server. This feature is essential for applications that provide downloadable content such as reports, images, or software.

## Real-Life Example
Think of an e-commerce platform:
- Users download invoices or product manuals.

## Code Example
Using Express to handle file downloads:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();

// Route for file download
app.get('/download', (req, res) => {
  const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'files', 'example.pdf');
  res.download(filePath, 'example.pdf', (err) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('Error downloading file:', err);
    }
  });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```
