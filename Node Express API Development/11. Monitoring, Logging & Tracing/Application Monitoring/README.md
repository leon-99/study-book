# Application Monitoring

## Introduction
Application monitoring involves tracking the performance and health of an application in real-time. It helps developers identify and resolve issues before they impact users.

## Real-Life Example
Think of a car dashboard:
- The dashboard displays real-time information about the car's performance, such as speed and fuel level.

## Code Example
Using `prom-client` for monitoring:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const client = require('prom-client');
const app = express();

const collectDefaultMetrics = client.collectDefaultMetrics;
collectDefaultMetrics();

const httpRequestDurationMicroseconds = new client.Histogram({
  name: 'http_request_duration_ms',
  help: 'Duration of HTTP requests in ms',
  labelNames: ['method', 'route', 'status_code'],
  buckets: [50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500],
});

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const end = httpRequestDurationMicroseconds.startTimer();
  res.on('finish', () => {
    end({ method: req.method, route: req.route?.path || req.path, status_code: res.statusCode });
  });
  next();
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello, world!'));

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors application performance in real-time.
- **Issue Detection**: Identifies bottlenecks and errors.
- **User Experience**: Ensures a smooth user experience.

## Real-Life Usage
Application monitoring is used in production environments to ensure application reliability and performance.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Real-time insights.
- Helps identify and resolve issues quickly.
- Improves application reliability.

### Cons
- Requires additional setup and tools.
- May introduce slight overhead.

## Conclusion
Application monitoring is essential for maintaining the health and performance of an application. By implementing monitoring, developers can ensure a reliable and user-friendly experience.
