# Error Tracking

## Introduction
Error tracking involves monitoring and logging errors in an application to identify and resolve issues quickly. It is essential for maintaining application reliability.

## Real-Life Example
Think of a fire alarm system:
- The alarm detects and alerts about fires, allowing for quick action.

## Code Example
Using `Sentry` for error tracking:
```javascript
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');

Sentry.init({ dsn: 'your-dsn-url' });

try {
  throw new Error('Something went wrong');
} catch (error) {
  Sentry.captureException(error);
}
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Issue Detection**: Identifies errors in real-time.
- **Debugging**: Simplifies the process of resolving issues.
- **Monitoring**: Tracks error trends and patterns.

## Real-Life Usage
Error tracking is used in production environments to monitor and resolve issues quickly.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Real-time error detection.
- Simplifies debugging.
- Improves application reliability.

### Cons
- Requires integration with third-party tools.
- May introduce slight overhead.

## Conclusion
Error tracking is a vital practice for maintaining application reliability. By implementing error tracking, developers can identify and resolve issues quickly, ensuring a smooth user experience.
