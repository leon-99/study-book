# Distributed Tracing

## Introduction
Distributed tracing involves tracking requests as they flow through different services in a distributed system. It helps developers identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.

## Real-Life Example
Think of a package delivery system:
- The journey of a package is tracked from the sender to the recipient, ensuring timely delivery.

## Code Example
Using `jaeger-client` for distributed tracing:
```javascript
const initTracer = require('jaeger-client').initTracer;

const config = {
  serviceName: 'my-service',
  reporter: {
    logSpans: true,
  },
  sampler: {
    type: 'const',
    param: 1,
  },
};

const options = {};
const tracer = initTracer(config, options);

const span = tracer.startSpan('my-operation');
span.log({ event: 'operation-start' });
// Perform some operation
span.finish();
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Request Tracking**: Tracks requests across multiple services.
- **Performance Optimization**: Identifies bottlenecks in the system.
- **Debugging**: Simplifies debugging in distributed systems.

## Real-Life Usage
Distributed tracing is used in microservices architectures to monitor and optimize system performance.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Provides end-to-end visibility.
- Identifies performance bottlenecks.
- Simplifies debugging.

### Cons
- Requires additional setup and tools.
- May introduce slight overhead.

## Conclusion
Distributed tracing is a critical practice for monitoring and optimizing distributed systems. By implementing tracing, developers can ensure system reliability and performance.
