# Entities

## Introduction
Entities are objects that have a unique identity and are defined by their attributes and behavior. In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), entities represent core business concepts.

## Real-Life Example
Consider an e-commerce platform:
- A `User` entity has attributes like `id`, `name`, and `email`.
- The `id` uniquely identifies the user, even if other attributes change.

## Code Example
Defining a `User` entity in Node.js:
```javascript
class User {
  constructor(id, name, email) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
  }

  updateEmail(newEmail) {
    this.email = newEmail;
  }
}

module.exports = User;
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Identity Management**: Ensures each entity is uniquely identifiable.
- **Encapsulation**: Combines data and behavior in a single object.
- **Consistency**: Maintains the integrity of business rules.

## Real-Life Usage
Entities are used in:
- User management systems.
- Inventory tracking.
- Financial applications.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Provides a clear representation of business concepts.
- Encapsulates behavior and data.
- Ensures consistency through unique identity.

### Cons
- Requires careful design to avoid complexity.
- May lead to tightly coupled code if not managed properly.

## Conclusion
Entities are a fundamental building block of DDD. By focusing on identity and behavior, they provide a robust way to model core business concepts.
