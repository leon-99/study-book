# Value Objects

## Introduction
Value objects are immutable objects that are defined by their attributes rather than a unique identity. In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), they represent concepts that are interchangeable if their attributes are the same.

## Real-Life Example
Consider an e-commerce platform:
- An `Address` value object has attributes like `street`, `city`, and `zipCode`.
- Two addresses with the same attributes are considered equal.

## Code Example
Defining an `Address` value object in Node.js:
```javascript
class Address {
  constructor(street, city, zipCode) {
    this.street = street;
    this.city = city;
    this.zipCode = zipCode;
  }

  equals(otherAddress) {
    return (
      this.street === otherAddress.street &&
      this.city === otherAddress.city &&
      this.zipCode === otherAddress.zipCode
    );
  }
}

module.exports = Address;
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Immutability**: Prevents unintended changes to data.
- **Equality**: Provides a clear way to compare objects.
- **Reusability**: Encapsulates common concepts in a reusable way.

## Real-Life Usage
Value objects are used in:
- Address management.
- Financial calculations (e.g., `Money` value object).
- Geographic coordinates.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Simplifies comparison and equality checks.
- Promotes immutability and reusability.
- Reduces complexity by focusing on attributes.

### Cons
- Requires additional effort to implement immutability.
- May lead to duplication if not reused effectively.

## Conclusion
Value objects are a powerful tool in DDD. By focusing on attributes and immutability, they provide a robust way to model interchangeable concepts.
