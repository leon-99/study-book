# Domain Events

## Introduction
Domain events are a way to capture and communicate significant changes in the domain. In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), they enable decoupled communication between different parts of the system.

## Real-Life Example
Consider an e-commerce platform:
- When an order is placed, a `OrderPlaced` domain event is generated.
- Other services like inventory and notifications consume the event to perform their respective tasks.

## Code Example
Defining and handling a domain event in Node.js:

1. Define the event:
```javascript
class OrderPlaced {
  constructor(orderId, userId) {
    this.orderId = orderId;
    this.userId = userId;
    this.timestamp = new Date();
  }
}

module.exports = OrderPlaced;
```

2. Publish the event:
```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const eventBus = new EventEmitter();
const OrderPlaced = require('./OrderPlaced');

function placeOrder(orderId, userId) {
  const event = new OrderPlaced(orderId, userId);
  eventBus.emit('OrderPlaced', event);
}

module.exports = { placeOrder, eventBus };
```

3. Subscribe to the event:
```javascript
const { eventBus } = require('./placeOrder');

eventBus.on('OrderPlaced', (event) => {
  console.log(`Order placed: ${event.orderId} by user ${event.userId}`);
});
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Decoupling**: Reduces dependencies between services.
- **Scalability**: Enables asynchronous processing of events.
- **Auditability**: Provides a record of significant domain changes.

## Real-Life Usage
Domain events are used in:
- Order processing systems.
- Event-driven architectures.
- Financial applications.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Promotes decoupling and scalability.
- Simplifies communication between services.
- Provides a clear record of domain changes.

### Cons
- Adds complexity to the system.
- Requires robust event handling mechanisms.
- May lead to eventual consistency issues.

## Conclusion
Domain events are a powerful concept in DDD. By capturing and communicating significant changes, they enable decoupled and scalable systems.
