# Aggregates

## Introduction
Aggregates are clusters of entities and value objects that are treated as a single unit. In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), aggregates enforce consistency and encapsulate business rules.

## Real-Life Example
Consider an e-commerce platform:
- An `Order` aggregate includes entities like `OrderItem` and value objects like `ShippingAddress`.
- The `Order` aggregate ensures that all items and the shipping address are valid.

## Code Example
Defining an `Order` aggregate in Node.js:
```javascript
class Order {
  constructor(id, items, shippingAddress) {
    this.id = id;
    this.items = items; // Array of OrderItem entities
    this.shippingAddress = shippingAddress; // Value object
  }

  addItem(item) {
    this.items.push(item);
  }

  updateShippingAddress(newAddress) {
    this.shippingAddress = newAddress;
  }
}

module.exports = Order;
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Consistency**: Ensures business rules are enforced within the aggregate.
- **Encapsulation**: Hides internal details from external access.
- **Transaction Management**: Treats the aggregate as a single unit of work.

## Real-Life Usage
Aggregates are used in:
- Order management systems.
- Inventory tracking.
- Financial applications.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Enforces consistency within the aggregate.
- Simplifies transaction management.
- Encapsulates business rules.

### Cons
- Requires careful design to avoid complexity.
- May lead to performance issues if aggregates are too large.

## Conclusion
Aggregates are a key concept in DDD. By grouping related entities and value objects, they provide a robust way to enforce consistency and encapsulate business rules.
