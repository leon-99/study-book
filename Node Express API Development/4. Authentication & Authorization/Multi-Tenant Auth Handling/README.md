# Multi-Tenant Auth Handling

## Introduction
Multi-tenant authentication is a strategy used to manage authentication and authorization for multiple tenants (e.g., organizations, clients) within a single application. Each tenant can have its own users, roles, and permissions, ensuring data isolation and security.

## Real-Life Example
Think of a co-working space:
- Each company (tenant) has its own office space (data) and employees (users).
- Employees can access only their company’s resources, not others.

## Code Example
Using middleware for tenant-based authentication:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Mock tenants and users
const tenants = {
  tenant1: { users: ['user1', 'user2'] },
  tenant2: { users: ['user3', 'user4'] }
};

// Tenant middleware
const tenantMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  const tenantId = req.headers['x-tenant-id'];
  if (!tenantId || !tenants[tenantId]) {
    return res.status(403).send('Invalid Tenant');
  }
  req.tenant = tenants[tenantId];
  next();
};

// Routes
app.use(tenantMiddleware);

app.get('/data', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Data for tenant: ${JSON.stringify(req.tenant)}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Data Isolation**: Ensures each tenant’s data is separate and secure.
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple tenants within a single application.
- **Customizability**: Allows tenant-specific configurations and permissions.

## Real-Life Usage
Multi-tenant authentication is widely used in SaaS applications like Slack, where each workspace (tenant) has its own users, channels, and settings.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Ensures data isolation and security.
- Supports tenant-specific customizations.
- Scales well for multi-tenant architectures.

### Cons
- Adds complexity to authentication and authorization.
- Requires careful management of tenant data and configurations.

## Conclusion
Multi-tenant authentication is a critical feature for applications serving multiple clients or organizations. By implementing tenant-based authentication, developers can ensure secure and scalable access control for their applications.
