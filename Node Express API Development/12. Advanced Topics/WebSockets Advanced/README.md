# WebSockets Advanced

## Introduction
WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection. They are ideal for real-time applications like chat apps, live notifications, and collaborative tools. Advanced WebSocket implementations include features like authentication, scaling, and handling high-concurrency scenarios.

## Real-Life Example
Consider a stock trading platform:
- Real-time updates of stock prices are pushed to users.
- WebSockets ensure low-latency communication for a seamless user experience.

## Code Example
Using `ws` library for an advanced WebSocket server:

1. Install the `ws` library:
```bash
npm install ws
```

2. Create a WebSocket server:
```javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  console.log('New client connected');

  // Handle incoming messages
  ws.on('message', (message) => {
    console.log(`Received: ${message}`);

    // Broadcast to all clients
    wss.clients.forEach((client) => {
      if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        client.send(`Server: ${message}`);
      }
    });
  });

  // Handle client disconnection
  ws.on('close', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected');
  });

  // Send a welcome message
  ws.send('Welcome to the WebSocket server!');
});

console.log('WebSocket server running on ws://localhost:8080');
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Real-Time Communication**: Enables instant data exchange between client and server.
- **Low Latency**: Reduces the delay compared to traditional HTTP requests.
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple concurrent connections.

## Real-Life Usage
WebSockets are used in:
- Chat applications (e.g., Slack, WhatsApp Web).
- Real-time dashboards and analytics.
- Multiplayer online games.
- Collaborative tools (e.g., Google Docs).

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Low-latency, real-time communication.
- Efficient use of network resources.
- Persistent connection reduces overhead.

### Cons
- Requires additional effort for scaling (e.g., load balancing).
- Not suitable for all use cases (e.g., simple CRUD operations).
- May face compatibility issues with older proxies and firewalls.

## Conclusion
Advanced WebSocket implementations are essential for building robust real-time applications. By leveraging WebSockets, developers can create highly interactive and responsive user experiences.
