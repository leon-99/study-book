# TypedArrays

## Introduction
TypedArrays are advanced data structures in JavaScript that provide a way to work with binary data. They are used for handling raw binary data in scenarios like file processing, image manipulation, and WebGL.

## Real-Life Example
Think of a photo editor:
- The editor processes raw image data to apply filters and effects.

## Code Example
Using TypedArrays:
```javascript
// Create a TypedArray
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16);
const int32View = new Int32Array(buffer);
int32View[0] = 42;
console.log(int32View[0]); // Output: 42
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Binary Data Handling**: Processes raw binary data efficiently.
- **Performance**: Provides fast access to data.
- **Compatibility**: Works with WebGL and other APIs.

## Real-Life Usage
TypedArrays are used in applications like video processing, game development, and scientific computing.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Fast and efficient.
- Supports binary data.
- Compatible with various APIs.

### Cons
- Requires additional knowledge.
- Limited to specific use cases.

## Conclusion
TypedArrays are powerful tools for handling binary data in JavaScript. By using these structures, developers can build high-performance applications.
