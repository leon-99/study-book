# Dynamic Routes

## Introduction
Dynamic routes in Express.js allow developers to define routes with parameters that can capture values from the URL. This feature is essential for building flexible and dynamic web applications.

## Real-Life Example
Think of a postal service:
- A delivery address (dynamic route) can vary for each package (request), but the delivery process (route handler) remains the same.

## Code Example
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Dynamic route with a parameter
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  res.send(`User ID: ${userId}`);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Flexibility**: Handles routes with varying parameters.
- **Scalability**: Simplifies adding new endpoints.
- **User Experience**: Enables personalized responses based on URL parameters.

## Real-Life Usage
Dynamic routes are widely used in applications like e-commerce platforms, where product pages are accessed using product IDs in the URL.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Provides flexibility in route definitions.
- Simplifies handling of dynamic data.
- Enhances user experience with personalized responses.

### Cons
- Requires careful validation of parameters.
- Can lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

## Conclusion
Dynamic routes are a powerful feature of Express.js that enable developers to build flexible and scalable web applications. By capturing values from the URL, dynamic routes provide a seamless way to handle varying user requests.
