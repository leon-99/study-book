# Route Composition

## Introduction
Route composition in Express.js involves organizing and combining routes to create a clean and maintainable routing structure. This is especially useful in large applications with multiple endpoints.

## Real-Life Example
Think of a cityâ€™s transportation system:
- Different bus routes (API routes) are organized into a network (application) to efficiently serve passengers (requests).

## Code Example
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// User routes
const userRouter = express.Router();
userRouter.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('User List'));
userRouter.post('/', (req, res) => res.send('Create User'));

// Product routes
const productRouter = express.Router();
productRouter.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Product List'));
productRouter.post('/', (req, res) => res.send('Create Product'));

// Compose routes
app.use('/users', userRouter);
app.use('/products', productRouter);

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Modularity**: Separates routes into logical groups.
- **Scalability**: Simplifies adding new routes.
- **Maintainability**: Makes the routing structure easier to understand.

## Real-Life Usage
Route composition is widely used in applications with multiple modules, such as e-commerce platforms, where user, product, and order routes are organized separately.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Promotes modularity and scalability.
- Simplifies route management.
- Enhances code readability.

### Cons
- Requires additional setup.
- Can become complex in very large applications.

## Conclusion
Route composition is a best practice for organizing routes in Express.js applications. By grouping and combining routes, developers can create a clean and maintainable routing structure that scales with the application.
