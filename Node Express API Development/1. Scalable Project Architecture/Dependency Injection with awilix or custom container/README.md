# Dependency Injection with awilix or Custom Container

## Introduction
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows the injection of dependencies into a component, rather than the component creating them itself. In Node.js, libraries like `awilix` provide a powerful way to implement DI, enabling better modularity and testability.

## Real-Life Example
Think of a coffee shop:
- The barista (component) doesn't grow coffee beans (dependency) but gets them from a supplier (DI container).
- This allows the barista to focus on making coffee, while the supplier ensures a steady supply of beans.

## Code Example
Using `awilix` for DI:
```javascript
const { createContainer, asClass, asFunction, asValue } = require('awilix');

// Create a container
const container = createContainer();

// Register dependencies
container.register({
  userService: asClass(require('./userService')).singleton(),
  userRepository: asClass(require('./userRepository')).singleton(),
  db: asValue(require('./db'))
});

// Resolve dependencies
const userService = container.resolve('userService');

// Use the resolved service
userService.getUserById(1).then(user => console.log(user));
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Modularity**: Components are decoupled from their dependencies.
- **Testability**: Dependencies can be mocked or replaced during testing.
- **Scalability**: Easier to manage dependencies in large applications.

## Real-Life Usage
DI is widely used in enterprise applications to manage complex dependency graphs. For example, in a banking system, services like account management, transaction processing, and notification handling can be injected as needed.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Decouples components from their dependencies.
- Improves testability and maintainability.
- Simplifies dependency management.

### Cons
- Can introduce complexity.
- Requires learning and setting up a DI library.

## Conclusion
Dependency Injection is a powerful pattern for managing dependencies in Node.js applications. By using libraries like `awilix`, developers can create modular, testable, and scalable applications with ease.
