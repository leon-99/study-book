# Repository Pattern & Service Abstractions

## Introduction
The Repository Pattern is a design pattern that abstracts the data access layer, providing a clean API for the business logic layer. Service abstractions further decouple the business logic from the data layer, making the application more modular and testable.

## Real-Life Example
Think of a library:
- The **Repository** is like the catalog system that abstracts the details of where books are stored.
- The **Service** is the librarian who uses the catalog to fetch or update book information for the users.

## Code Example
```javascript
// Repository
class UserRepository {
  constructor(db) {
    this.db = db;
  }

  async findById(id) {
    return this.db.users.find(user => user.id === id);
  }

  async save(user) {
    this.db.users.push(user);
    return user;
  }
}

// Service
class UserService {
  constructor(userRepository) {
    this.userRepository = userRepository;
  }

  async getUserById(id) {
    return await this.userRepository.findById(id);
  }

  async createUser(user) {
    return await this.userRepository.save(user);
  }
}

// Usage
const db = { users: [] };
const userRepository = new UserRepository(db);
const userService = new UserService(userRepository);

userService.createUser({ id: 1, name: 'John Doe' }).then(user => console.log(user));
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Separation of Concerns**: Decouples data access from business logic.
- **Testability**: Easier to mock repositories and services during testing.
- **Scalability**: Simplifies adding new data sources or business rules.

## Real-Life Usage
This pattern is widely used in enterprise applications, such as CRM systems, where different data sources (e.g., databases, APIs) need to be abstracted for the business logic.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Promotes separation of concerns.
- Improves testability and maintainability.
- Simplifies data access and business logic.

### Cons
- Can introduce complexity.
- Requires additional layers of abstraction.

## Conclusion
The Repository Pattern and Service Abstractions are essential for building scalable and maintainable applications. By decoupling data access and business logic, they ensure a clean and modular architecture.
