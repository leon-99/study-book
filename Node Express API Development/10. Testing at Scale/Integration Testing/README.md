# Integration Testing

## Introduction
Integration testing involves testing multiple components or modules of an application together to ensure they work as expected when combined.

## Real-Life Example
Think of a car assembly:
- After testing individual parts, they are assembled and tested together to ensure the car functions as a whole.

## Code Example
Using Jest and Supertest for integration testing:
```javascript
const request = require('supertest');
const express = require('express');

const app = express();
app.get('/user', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ name: 'John Doe' });
});

test('GET /user returns user data', async () => {
  const response = await request(app).get('/user');
  expect(response.status).toBe(200);
  expect(response.body.name).toBe('John Doe');
});
```

## Problems It Solves
- **Module Interaction**: Ensures different modules work together.
- **Bug Detection**: Identifies issues in module interactions.
- **System Reliability**: Validates the application as a whole.

## Real-Life Usage
Integration testing is used in applications to ensure seamless interaction between different components or services.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- Validates module interactions.
- Detects integration issues.
- Improves system reliability.

### Cons
- Slower than unit tests.
- More complex to set up.

## Conclusion
Integration testing is essential for ensuring that different parts of an application work together seamlessly. By writing integration tests, developers can build reliable and robust systems.
