# Webpack, Vite, and Rollup

## Introduction
Webpack, Vite, and Rollup are popular JavaScript bundlers and build tools that optimize and bundle code for deployment.

## Real-Life Example
Consider a large web application with multiple JavaScript files. Bundlers combine these files into a single optimized bundle for faster loading.

## Code Example
```javascript
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: __dirname + '/dist',
  },
};
```

## Problems It Solves
- Optimizes code for production
- Reduces load times

## Real-Life Usage
1. **Web Development**: Bundling and optimizing assets.
2. **Library Development**: Creating distributable packages.

## Pros
- Improves performance
- Supports advanced features like code splitting

## Cons
- Requires configuration
- Can be complex to set up

## Conclusion
Webpack, Vite, and Rollup are powerful tools for modern JavaScript development, enabling developers to optimize and bundle code for efficient deployment.
