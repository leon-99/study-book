# Error Stack Trace Analysis

## Introduction
Error stack traces in JavaScript provide detailed information about the sequence of function calls that led to an error. Analyzing stack traces is essential for debugging and identifying the root cause of errors.

## Real-Life Example
Consider a web application that crashes due to a runtime error. The stack trace helps pinpoint the exact line of code causing the issue.

## Code Example
```javascript
function functionA() {
  functionB();
}

function functionB() {
  throw new Error('Something went wrong');
}

try {
  functionA();
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error.stack);
}
```

## Problems It Solves
- Identifies the root cause of errors
- Provides a clear sequence of function calls

## Real-Life Usage
1. **Debugging**: Tracing errors in complex applications.
2. **Error reporting**: Logging stack traces for analysis.

## Pros
- Provides detailed error information
- Simplifies debugging

## Cons
- Can be overwhelming for beginners
- May expose sensitive information in production

## Conclusion
Error stack trace analysis is a critical skill for debugging JavaScript applications, enabling developers to quickly identify and resolve issues.
