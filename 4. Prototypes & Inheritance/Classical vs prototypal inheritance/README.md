## Introduction
JavaScript supports two main types of inheritance: classical inheritance (used in languages like Java) and prototypal inheritance (native to JavaScript). Understanding the differences between these two paradigms is crucial for writing effective JavaScript code.

## Real-Life Example
Think of a family tree. In classical inheritance, traits are passed down in a rigid hierarchy, like a royal family. In prototypal inheritance, traits can be shared more flexibly, like borrowing tools from a neighbor.

### Code Example
```javascript
// Classical Inheritance
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
    }
}

const dog = new Dog('Rex');
dog.speak(); // Rex barks.

// Prototypal Inheritance
const animal = {
    speak: function() {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
    }
};

const dogProto = Object.create(animal);
dogProto.name = 'Rex';
dogProto.speak(); // Rex makes a noise.
```

## Problems It Solves
1. **Code Reusability**: Allows objects to share methods and properties.
2. **Flexibility**: Supports different inheritance paradigms.

## Real-Life Usage
1. **Frameworks**: Many frameworks use prototypal inheritance for extensibility.
2. **Object-Oriented Design**: Implementing inheritance in applications.

## Pros
- **Classical Inheritance**: Familiar to developers from other languages.
- **Prototypal Inheritance**: More flexible and dynamic.

## Cons
- **Classical Inheritance**: Can be rigid and verbose.
- **Prototypal Inheritance**: Can be harder to understand for newcomers.

## Conclusion
Both classical and prototypal inheritance have their strengths and weaknesses. By understanding the differences, developers can choose the right approach for their specific use case.
