# Type Checking with TypeScript (Deep Integration)

## Introduction
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, enabling developers to catch errors early and write more robust code.

## Real-Life Example
Consider a large-scale application where strict type checking is essential to prevent runtime errors and improve maintainability.

## Code Example
```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

greet(42); // Error: Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
```

## Problems It Solves
- Catches type-related errors during development
- Improves code maintainability and scalability

## Real-Life Usage
1. **Enterprise Applications**: Ensuring type safety in large projects.
2. **Library Development**: Providing type definitions for users.

## Pros
- Deep integration with IDEs
- Comprehensive type checking

## Cons
- Requires a learning curve
- Adds a build step

## Conclusion
TypeScript is the gold standard for type checking in JavaScript, offering deep integration and robust features for modern development.
