# Currying and Partial Application

## Introduction
Currying and partial application are techniques in functional programming that transform functions to make them more reusable and composable. Currying breaks a function with multiple arguments into a series of functions, each taking a single argument. Partial application fixes some arguments of a function, creating a new function with fewer arguments.

## Real-Life Example
Imagine a function that calculates the total price of items with tax. Currying allows you to create a specialized function for a specific tax rate.

## Code Example
```javascript
// Currying
function multiply(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return a * b;
  };
}

const double = multiply(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10

// Partial Application
function add(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

const add5 = add.bind(null, 5);
console.log(add5(3, 2)); // 10
```

## Problems It Solves
- Enhances code reusability
- Simplifies function composition

## Real-Life Usage
1. **Configuration**: Creating specialized functions for specific configurations.
2. **Libraries**: Many functional programming libraries use currying and partial application.

## Pros
- Improves code readability
- Encourages modular design

## Cons
- Can be confusing for beginners
- May lead to performance overhead

## Conclusion
Currying and partial application are powerful techniques for creating reusable and composable functions, making them essential tools in functional programming.
