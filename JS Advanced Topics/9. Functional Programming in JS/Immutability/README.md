# Immutability

## Introduction
Immutability is a principle in functional programming where data cannot be changed after it is created. Instead, new data structures are created for every modification, ensuring data integrity.

## Real-Life Example
Imagine a bank account system where transaction history must remain unchanged. Immutability ensures that past transactions are not accidentally modified.

## Code Example
```javascript
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
const newArray = [...originalArray, 4];

console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(newArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## Problems It Solves
- Prevents unintended side effects
- Simplifies debugging

## Real-Life Usage
1. **State management**: Libraries like Redux rely on immutability.
2. **Concurrency**: Immutable data structures are thread-safe.

## Pros
- Enhances code reliability
- Simplifies testing

## Cons
- May lead to performance overhead
- Requires additional memory

## Conclusion
Immutability is a key concept in functional programming, promoting data integrity and simplifying application development.
