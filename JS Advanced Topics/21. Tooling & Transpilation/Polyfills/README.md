# Polyfills

## Introduction
Polyfills are scripts that provide modern JavaScript features in older environments that do not natively support them.

## Real-Life Example
Consider using the `fetch` API in a project that needs to support older browsers like Internet Explorer.

## Code Example
```javascript
// Polyfill for fetch
if (!window.fetch) {
  window.fetch = function(url) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
      xhr.open('GET', url);
      xhr.onload = () => resolve({ json: () => JSON.parse(xhr.responseText) });
      xhr.onerror = () => reject(xhr.statusText);
      xhr.send();
    });
  };
}
```

## Problems It Solves
- Ensures compatibility with older environments
- Allows the use of modern features

## Real-Life Usage
1. **Web Development**: Supporting older browsers.
2. **Library Development**: Ensuring compatibility across environments.

## Pros
- Extends functionality to older environments
- Easy to implement

## Cons
- Increases bundle size
- May impact performance

## Conclusion
Polyfills are a practical solution for ensuring compatibility with older environments, enabling developers to use modern JavaScript features without sacrificing support.
