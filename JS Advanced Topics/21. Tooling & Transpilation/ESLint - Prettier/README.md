# ESLint and Prettier

## Introduction
ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code. Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that ensures consistent code style.

## Real-Life Example
Consider a team project where consistent code style and error-free code are essential for collaboration and maintainability.

## Code Example
```javascript
// ESLint Example
if (true) console.log('Hello'); // Warning: Expected { after 'if' condition

// Prettier Example
const greet = (name) => {return `Hello, ${name}`;} // Reformatted to:
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}`;
```

## Problems It Solves
- Improves code quality and readability
- Reduces code review overhead

## Real-Life Usage
1. **Team Projects**: Enforcing coding standards.
2. **Open Source**: Maintaining consistent style across contributions.

## Pros
- Improves code quality
- Reduces bugs

## Cons
- Requires setup and configuration
- May enforce strict rules

## Conclusion
ESLint and Prettier are indispensable tools for maintaining high-quality, consistent, and error-free JavaScript code.
