# Web Workers

## Introduction
Web workers in JavaScript allow developers to run scripts in the background, separate from the main thread, enabling better performance for computationally intensive tasks.

## Real-Life Example
Consider a data visualization application that processes large datasets. Web workers can handle the processing without blocking the UI.

## Code Example
```javascript
// worker.js
self.onmessage = event => {
  const result = event.data * 2;
  self.postMessage(result);
};

// main.js
const worker = new Worker('worker.js');
worker.onmessage = event => console.log('Result:', event.data);
worker.postMessage(10); // Sends data to the worker
```

## Problems It Solves
- Prevents UI blocking
- Enables parallel processing

## Real-Life Usage
1. **Data processing**: Handling large datasets.
2. **Background tasks**: Running tasks without affecting the UI.

## Pros
- Improves performance
- Runs independently of the main thread

## Cons
- Limited to specific use cases
- Requires additional setup

## Conclusion
Web workers are a valuable tool for improving performance in JavaScript applications, especially for computationally intensive tasks.
