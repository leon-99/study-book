# IndexedDB

## Introduction
IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of large amounts of structured data, including files and blobs. It is ideal for offline applications and complex data storage needs.

## Real-Life Example
Consider a note-taking application that stores user notes locally, allowing offline access and synchronization when online.

## Code Example
```javascript
const request = indexedDB.open('MyDatabase', 1);

request.onupgradeneeded = event => {
  const db = event.target.result;
  db.createObjectStore('notes', { keyPath: 'id' });
};

request.onsuccess = event => {
  const db = event.target.result;
  const transaction = db.transaction('notes', 'readwrite');
  const store = transaction.objectStore('notes');
  store.add({ id: 1, content: 'Learn IndexedDB' });
};
```

## Problems It Solves
- Provides persistent client-side storage
- Enables offline functionality

## Real-Life Usage
1. **Offline apps**: Storing data for offline access.
2. **Complex data**: Managing structured data locally.

## Pros
- Supports large data storage
- Works offline

## Cons
- Complex API
- Limited browser support

## Conclusion
IndexedDB is a powerful tool for client-side data storage, enabling developers to build robust offline applications with complex data needs.
