# Memory Leaks (Closures, DOM References)

## Introduction
Memory leaks occur when memory that is no longer needed is not released, leading to increased memory usage and potential application crashes. Common causes include closures and DOM references.

## Real-Life Example
Imagine a web application with a modal that is frequently opened and closed. If event listeners attached to the modal are not removed, memory leaks can occur.

## Code Example
```javascript
// Example of a memory leak
function createLeak() {
  const element = document.createElement('div');
  document.body.appendChild(element);
  element.addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Clicked');
  });
}

createLeak();
```

## Problems It Solves
- Identifies and prevents memory leaks
- Ensures efficient memory usage

## Real-Life Usage
1. **Event listeners**: Removing listeners when they are no longer needed.
2. **Closures**: Avoiding unnecessary references to variables.

## Pros
- Improves application stability
- Reduces memory usage

## Cons
- Requires careful coding practices
- Can be hard to debug

## Conclusion
Understanding and preventing memory leaks is essential for building stable and efficient applications, especially in long-running or resource-intensive environments.
