# try...catch...finally

## Introduction
The `try...catch...finally` statement in JavaScript provides a structured way to handle errors and execute cleanup code, ensuring application stability.

## Real-Life Example
Consider a file upload process where errors need to be handled gracefully, and cleanup actions (e.g., removing temporary files) must always be performed.

## Code Example
```javascript
try {
  console.log('Trying to execute code');
  throw new Error('An error occurred');
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Caught an error:', error.message);
} finally {
  console.log('Cleanup actions');
}
```

## Problems It Solves
- Handles runtime errors gracefully
- Ensures cleanup actions are always executed

## Real-Life Usage
1. **File operations**: Ensuring files are closed after reading or writing.
2. **API calls**: Handling errors and cleaning up resources.

## Pros
- Provides a clear error-handling structure
- Ensures cleanup code is always executed

## Cons
- Can lead to verbose code
- May hide errors if not used carefully

## Conclusion
The `try...catch...finally` statement is a fundamental tool for error handling in JavaScript, enabling developers to write robust and stable applications.
