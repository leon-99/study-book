# TypedArrays

## Introduction
`TypedArray` is a collection of array-like objects in JavaScript that provide a mechanism for accessing raw binary data. They are used for high-performance operations on binary data.

## Real-Life Example
Consider a graphics application that manipulates pixel data. `TypedArray` can be used to store and process this data efficiently.

## Code Example
```javascript
const typedArray = new Uint8Array(4);
typedArray[0] = 255;
console.log(typedArray); // Uint8Array [ 255, 0, 0, 0 ]
```

## Problems It Solves
- Efficient handling of binary data
- Provides a way to work with raw memory

## Real-Life Usage
1. **Graphics processing**: Manipulating pixel data.
2. **WebAssembly**: Interfacing with binary data.

## Pros
- High performance
- Fine-grained control over data

## Cons
- Requires understanding of binary data
- Limited to specific use cases

## Conclusion
`TypedArray` is a powerful tool for working with binary data, enabling high-performance applications in JavaScript.
