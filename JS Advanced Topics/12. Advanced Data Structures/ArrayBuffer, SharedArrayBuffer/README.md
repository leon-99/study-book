# ArrayBuffer and SharedArrayBuffer

## Introduction
`ArrayBuffer` and `SharedArrayBuffer` are low-level data structures in JavaScript that allow developers to work with raw binary data. While `ArrayBuffer` is used for private memory, `SharedArrayBuffer` enables shared memory between threads.

## Real-Life Example
Consider a video processing application that needs to handle raw binary data for frames. `ArrayBuffer` can be used to store and manipulate this data efficiently.

## Code Example
```javascript
// ArrayBuffer example
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16); // Create a buffer of 16 bytes
const view = new DataView(buffer);
view.setInt8(0, 42);
console.log(view.getInt8(0)); // 42

// SharedArrayBuffer example (requires a worker)
const sharedBuffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(16);
const sharedView = new Int32Array(sharedBuffer);
sharedView[0] = 42;
console.log(sharedView[0]); // 42
```

## Problems It Solves
- Efficient handling of binary data
- Enables shared memory for multithreading

## Real-Life Usage
1. **WebAssembly**: Passing binary data between JavaScript and WebAssembly.
2. **Multithreading**: Using `SharedArrayBuffer` for shared memory in web workers.

## Pros
- High performance
- Fine-grained control over memory

## Cons
- Complex to use
- Requires understanding of binary data

## Conclusion
`ArrayBuffer` and `SharedArrayBuffer` are powerful tools for working with binary data and multithreading, but they require a solid understanding of low-level programming concepts.
