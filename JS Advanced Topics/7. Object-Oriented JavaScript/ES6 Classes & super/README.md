## Introduction
ES6 classes in JavaScript provide a modern syntax for creating objects and implementing inheritance. The `super` keyword is used to call methods from a parent class, enabling more advanced inheritance patterns.

## Real-Life Example
Think of a car manufacturing process. A sports car inherits the basic features of a car (parent class) but adds its own unique features (child class).

### Code Example
```javascript
class Vehicle {
    constructor(type) {
        this.type = type;
    }

    start() {
        console.log(`${this.type} started.`);
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    constructor(type, brand) {
        super(type);
        this.brand = brand;
    }

    start() {
        super.start();
        console.log(`${this.brand} is ready to drive.`);
    }
}

const car = new Car('Sedan', 'Toyota');
car.start();
// Output:
// Sedan started.
// Toyota is ready to drive.
```

## Problems It Solves
1. **Readability**: Provides a clean and intuitive syntax for inheritance.
2. **Code Reusability**: Allows objects to share methods and properties.

## Real-Life Usage
1. **Object-Oriented Design**: Implementing inheritance in applications.
2. **Frameworks**: Many frameworks use classes for component creation.

## Pros
- **Readability**: Clean and intuitive syntax.
- **Flexibility**: Supports advanced inheritance patterns.

## Cons
- **Complexity**: Adds additional layers of abstraction.
- **Performance**: Can have a slight performance overhead.

## Conclusion
ES6 classes and the `super` keyword provide a modern and intuitive way to implement inheritance in JavaScript. By understanding how they work, developers can write more efficient and maintainable code.
