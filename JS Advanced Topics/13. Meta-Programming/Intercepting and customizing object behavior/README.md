# Intercepting and Customizing Object Behavior

## Introduction
Meta-programming in JavaScript allows developers to intercept and customize the behavior of objects. This is achieved using features like proxies and the Reflect API.

## Real-Life Example
Consider a logging system where every property access or method call on an object is logged. Intercepting object behavior makes this possible.

## Code Example
```javascript
const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };

const handler = {
  get(target, property) {
    console.log(`Accessing ${property}`);
    return target[property];
  },
};

const proxyUser = new Proxy(user, handler);
console.log(proxyUser.name); // Logs: Accessing name, then Alice
```

## Problems It Solves
- Enables dynamic behavior
- Simplifies debugging and logging

## Real-Life Usage
1. **Logging**: Intercepting property access for logging.
2. **Validation**: Adding runtime validation for object properties.

## Pros
- Highly flexible
- Enables advanced use cases

## Cons
- Can lead to complex code
- May impact performance

## Conclusion
Intercepting and customizing object behavior is a powerful feature of JavaScript, enabling developers to create dynamic and flexible applications.
