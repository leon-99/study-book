# Private Fields in Classes (#name)

## Introduction
Private fields in JavaScript classes, denoted by a `#` prefix, allow developers to define truly private properties that cannot be accessed or modified outside the class.

## Real-Life Example
Consider a banking system where account balances should not be directly accessible or modifiable from outside the class.

## Code Example
```javascript
class BankAccount {
  #balance;

  constructor(initialBalance) {
    this.#balance = initialBalance;
  }

  deposit(amount) {
    this.#balance += amount;
  }

  getBalance() {
    return this.#balance;
  }
}

const account = new BankAccount(100);
account.deposit(50);
console.log(account.getBalance()); // 150
console.log(account.#balance); // SyntaxError: Private field '#balance' must be declared in an enclosing class
```

## Problems It Solves
- Prevents accidental or unauthorized access to sensitive data
- Encourages encapsulation and better design

## Real-Life Usage
1. **Banking Systems**: Protecting sensitive financial data.
2. **Encapsulation**: Hiding implementation details.

## Pros
- True privacy for class fields
- Improves code security and maintainability

## Cons
- Not accessible for testing/debugging
- May require polyfills for older environments

## Conclusion
Private fields in classes provide a robust way to enforce encapsulation and protect sensitive data in JavaScript applications.
