# Garbage Collection

## Introduction
Garbage collection is a process in JavaScript that automatically frees up memory by removing objects that are no longer in use, ensuring efficient memory management.

## Real-Life Example
Consider a web application where users navigate between pages. Garbage collection ensures that memory used by the previous page is released when it is no longer needed.

## Code Example
```javascript
let obj = { name: 'John' };
obj = null; // The object is now eligible for garbage collection
```

## Problems It Solves
- Prevents memory leaks
- Simplifies memory management

## Real-Life Usage
1. **Single-page applications**: Managing memory as users navigate between views.
2. **Dynamic data**: Releasing memory used by temporary data structures.

## Pros
- Automatic memory management
- Reduces developer burden

## Cons
- Can cause performance hiccups during collection
- Not fully predictable

## Conclusion
Garbage collection is a critical feature of JavaScript, enabling developers to focus on application logic without worrying about manual memory management.
